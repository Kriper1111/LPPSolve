!! DANGER ZONE AHEAD !!
  Don't think of this file as a properly documented list of features pending
implementation. It's main goal is to be a post-it note for myself.
I'll remove the descriptions of targets once they're done.

[ ] Actual solution support
    --  the groundwork is kind of there, but needs proper
          implementation. We could also support cddlib's .ine/.ext
          files, those are pretty humanly readable.
    --  Some caveats to consider - the library accepts matrices in
          form of [b a1 a2 a3], fit into x1a1 + x2a2 + x3a3 + b >= 0
        So, coming from our "expected" x1a1 + x2a2 + x3a3 <= b
          form, we'll have to shuffle some values around.
        Additionally, we have to include x1, x2, x3 >= 0
        This could be done by appending last three rows of an 
          eye-matrix to the LP matrix.
    --  At some point, we should think of dynamic signs
          and quite possibly UI simplifications: hide zeroed out
          variables and remove equations.
        For latter, it's best if we collect them into a list,
          and run over it after we finish editing.
[ ] Actual zoom in support
    --  requires some clever thinks with grid scaling
[ ] Orthographic camera snapping
    --  Think Blender, but worse in UI and UX.
          So there's probably a button, best case scenario a UI button
          that snaps your camera to a top-down view and switches it to orthographic
          projection.
    --  It's somewhat implemented right now, except I can't get ortho to work
          properly. Really no ideas.
[ ] GitHub Actions workflow for crossplatform builds
    --  Probably requires movement towards the likes of CMake
    --  Definitely will hit the rate limit implementing
[ ] "Optimized" limit plane rendering
    Meaning we'll collect the transform matrices into one buffer
      and use that for rendering the planes, instanced.

[ ] Updated manual Object generation from vertex data:
    Follow FIXME in solver.cpp#L191
[ ] Object file bake script
    --  And either `make baked` or include it into `make build`/`make release` targets
[ ] CMake or just some tweaks to the Makefile.
    --  The Makefile is not quite release-ready. Best used by noone.
          I think the following "main" targets should be enough:
        - `make build` or `make release` for the release configuration
        - `make debug` for the debug configuration
          of course I can't not have `make bake` as a target, but it's an aux one.
        The debug target should somehow update the target objects/definitions when specified
          in a way that's compatible with the main compile workflow. Or just don't use extra
          objects in a debug build. Which is kind of a thing either way right now.
    --  Or as a remedy to the problems with multiconfigurations, I could *just* switch to
          CMake. But I'd like to keep the Makefile regardless. The fact that I am thinking of
          using CMake is not going to stop me from using the original Makefile for builds.
[ ] Quickhull via https://github.com/akuukka/quickhull from cddlib solutions.
[+] Autoresize the window [0.1.0]
[ ] Fix world orientation
    --  I'm not quite sure what that's supposed to mean, but I think it means
          "I've got a hunch that this thing is rotated wrong" or something.
          It should be mostly accurate though. Mostly.
( MANY MORE COMING )
